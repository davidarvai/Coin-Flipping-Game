# Coin-Flipping-Game

 This is a simple Haskell program for playing a coin flipping game.

Overview

  The program allows you to simulate flipping a set number of coins and achieving a target configuration by flipping a subset of those coins.

Features:

  • Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
  
  • Check if there is a valid solution for the given number of coins and flips.
  
  • Generate all possible flips for a given number of coins and flips.
  
  • Simulate the coin flipping process and check if the generated flips are legal.
  
  • Find the next possible states based on the current state of the game.
  
  • Find the solution to the game using a depth-first search algorithm.
